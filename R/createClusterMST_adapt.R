#' Minimum spanning trees on cluster centroids
#' Build a MST where each node is a cluster centroid and
#' each edge is weighted by the Euclidean distance between centroids.
#' This represents the most parsimonious explanation for a particular trajectory
#' and has the advantage of being directly intepretable with respect to any pre-existing clusters.
#'
#' @param x A numeric matrix of coordinates where each row represents a cell/sample and each column represents a dimension
#' (usually a PC or another low-dimensional embedding, but features or genes can also be used).
#'
#' Alternatively, a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} or \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object
#' containing such a matrix in its \code{\link{assays}}, as specified by \code{assay.type}.
#' This will be transposed prior to use.
#'
#' Alternatively, for \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}s, this matrix may be extracted from its \code{\link{reducedDims}},
#' based on the \code{use.dimred} specification.
#' In this case, no transposition is performed.
#'
#' Alternatively, if \code{clusters=NULL}, a numeric matrix of coordinates for cluster centroids,
#' where each row represents a cluster and each column represents a dimension
#' Each row should be named with the cluster name.
#' This mode can also be used with assays/matrices extracted from SummarizedExperiments and SingleCellExperiments.
#' @param ... For the generic, further arguments to pass to the specific methods.
#'
#' For the SummarizedExperiment method, further arguments to pass to the ANY method.
#'
#' For the SingleCellExperiment method, further arguments to pass to the SummarizedExperiment method
#' (if \code{use.dimred} is specified) or the ANY method (otherwise).
#' @param clusters A factor-like object of the same length as \code{nrow(x)},
#' specifying the cluster identity for each cell in \code{x}.
#' If \code{NULL}, \code{x} is assumed to already contain coordinates for the cluster centroids.
#'
#' Alternatively, a matrix with number of rows equal to \code{nrow(x)},
#' containing soft assignment weights for each cluster (column).
#' All weights should be positive and sum to 1 for each row.
#' @param columns A character, logical or integer vector specifying the columns of \code{x} to use.
#' If \code{NULL}, all provided columns are used by default.
#' @param outgroup A logical scalar indicating whether an outgroup should be inserted to split unrelated trajectories.
#' Alternatively, a numeric scalar specifying the distance threshold to use for this splitting.
#' @param outscale A numeric scalar specifying the scaling of the median distance between centroids,
#' used to define the threshold for outgroup splitting.
#' Only used if \code{outgroup=TRUE}.
#' @param endpoints A character vector of clusters that must be endpoints, i.e., nodes of degree 1 or lower in the MST.
#' @param assay.type An integer or string specifying the assay to use from a SummarizedExperiment \code{x}.
#' @param use.dimred An integer or string specifying the reduced dimensions to use from a SingleCellExperiment \code{x}.
#' @param use.median A logical scalar indicating whether cluster centroid coordinates should be computed using the median rather than mean.
#' @param dist.method A string specifying the distance measure to be used, see Details.
#' @param with.mnn Logical scalar, deprecated; use \code{dist.method="mnn"} instead.
#' @param mnn.k An integer scalar specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider for the MNN-based distance calculation when \code{dist.method="mnn"}.
#' See \code{\link[BiocNeighbors]{findMutualNN}} for more details.
#' @param BNPARAM A BiocNeighborParam object specifying how the nearest-neighbor search should be performed when \code{dist.method="mnn"},
#' see the \pkg{BiocNeighbors} package for more details.
#' @param BPPARAM A BiocParallelParam object specifying whether the nearest neighbor search should be parallelized when \code{dist.method="mnn"},
#' see the \pkg{BiocNeighbors} package for more details.
#'
#' @section Computing the centroids:
#' By default, the cluster centroid is defined by taking the mean value across all of its cells for each dimension.
#' If \code{clusters} is a matrix, a weighted mean is used instead.
#' This treats the column of weights as fractional identities of each cell to the corresponding cluster.
#'
#' If \code{use.median=TRUE}, the median across all cells in each cluster is used to compute the centroid coordinate for each dimension.
#' (With a matrix-like \code{clusters}, a weighted median is calculated.)
#' This protects against outliers but is less stable than the mean.
#' Enabling this option is advisable if one observes that the default centroid is not located near any of its points due to outliers.
#' Note that the centroids computed in this manner is not a true medoid, which was too much of a pain to compute.
#'
#' @section Introducing an outgroup:
#' If \code{outgroup=TRUE}, we add an outgroup to avoid constructing a trajectory between \dQuote{unrelated} clusters (Street et al., 2018).
#' This is done by adding an extra row/column to the distance matrix corresponding to an artificial outgroup cluster,
#' where the distance to all of the other real clusters is set to \eqn{\omega/2}.
#' Large jumps in the MST between real clusters that are more distant than \eqn{\omega} will then be rerouted through the outgroup,
#' allowing us to break up the MST into multiple subcomponents (i.e., a minimum spanning forest) by removing the outgroup.
#'
#' The default \eqn{\omega} value is computed by constructing the MST from the original distance matrix,
#' computing the median edge length in that MST, and then scaling it by \code{outscale}.
#' This adapts to the magnitude of the distances and the internal structure of the dataset
#' while also providing some margin for variation across cluster pairs.
#' The default \code{outscale=1.5} will break any branch that is 50\% longer than the median length.
#'
#' Alternatively, \code{outgroup} can be set to a numeric scalar in which case it is used directly as \eqn{\omega}.
#'
#' @section Forcing endpoints:
#' If certain clusters are known to be endpoints (e.g., because they represent terminal states), we can specify them in \code{endpoints}.
#' This ensures that the returned graph will have such clusters as nodes of degree 1, i.e., they terminate the path.
#' The function uses an exhaustive search to identify the MST with these constraints.
#' If no configuration can be found, an error is raised - this will occur if all nodes are specified as endpoints, for example.
#'
#' If \code{outgroup=TRUE}, the function is allowed to connect two endpoints together to create a two-node subcomponent.
#' This will result in the formation of a minimum spanning forest if there are more than two clusters in \code{x}.
#' Of course, if there are only two nodes and both are specified as endpoints, a two-node subcomponent will be formed regardless of \code{outgroup}.
#'
#' Note that edges involving endpoint nodes will have infinite confidence values (see below).
#' This reflects the fact that they are forced to exist during graph construction.
#'
#' @section Confidence on the edges:
#' For the MST, we obtain a measure of the confidence in each edge by computing the distance gained if that edge were not present.
#' Ambiguous parts of the tree will be less penalized from deletion of an edge, manifesting as a small distance gain.
#' In contrast, parts of the tree with clear structure will receive a large distance gain upon deletion of an obvious edge.
#'
#' For each edge, we divide the distance gain by the length of the edge to normalize for cluster resolution.
#' This avoids overly penalizing edges in parts of the tree involving broad clusters
#' while still retaining sensitivity to detect distance gain in overclustered regions.
#' As an example, a normalized gain of unity for a particular edge means that its removal
#' requires an alternative path that increases the distance travelled by that edge's length.
#'
#' The normalized gain is reported as the \code{"gain"} attribute in the edges of the MST from \code{\link{createClusterMST_adapt}}.
#' Note that the \code{"weight"} attribute represents the edge length.
#'
#' @section Distance measures:
#' Distances between cluster centroids may be calculated in multiple ways:
#' \itemize{
#' \item The default is \code{"simple"}, which computes the Euclidean distance between cluster centroids.
#' \item With \code{"scaled.diag"}, we downscale the distance between the centroids by the sum of the variances of the two corresponding clusters (i.e., the diagonal of the covariance matrix).
#' This accounts for the cluster \dQuote{width} by reducing the effective distances between broad clusters.
#' \item With \code{"scaled.full"}, we repeat this scaling with the full covariance matrix.
#' This accounts for the cluster shape by considering correlations between dimensions, but cannot be computed when there are more cells than dimensions.
#' \item The \code{"slingshot"} option will typically be equivalent to the \code{"scaled.full"} option,
#' but switches to \code{"scaled.diag"} in the presence of small clusters (fewer cells than dimensions in the reduced dimensional space).
#' \item For \code{"mnn"}, see the more detailed explanation below.
#' }
#'
#' If \code{clusters} is a matrix with \code{"scaled.diag"}, \code{"scaled.full"} and \code{"slingshot"},
#' a weighted covariance is computed to account for the assignment ambiguity.
#' In addition, a warning will be raised if \code{use.median=TRUE} for these choices of \code{dist.method};
#' the Mahalanobis distances will not be correctly computed when the centers are medians instead of means.
#'
#' @section Alternative distances with MNN pairs:
#' While distances between centroids are usually satisfactory for gauging cluster \dQuote{closeness},
#' they do not consider the behavior at the boundaries of the clusters.
#' Two clusters that are immediately adjacent (i.e., intermingling at the boundaries) may have a large distance between their centroids
#' if the clusters themselves span a large region of the coordinate space.
#' This may preclude the obvious edge from forming in the MST.
#'
#' In such cases, we can use an alternative distance calculation based on the distance between mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs).
#' An MNN pair is defined as two cells in separate clusters that are each other's nearest neighbors in the other cluster.
#' For each pair of clusters, we identify all MNN pairs and compute the median distance between them.
#' This distance is then used in place of the distance between centroids to construct the MST.
#' In this manner, we focus on cluster pairs that are close at their boundaries rather than at their centers.
#'
#' This mode can be enabled by setting \code{dist.method="mnn"}, while the stringency of the MNN definition can be set with \code{mnn.k}.
#' Similarly, the performance of the nearest neighbor search can be controlled with \code{BPPARAM} and \code{BSPARAM}.
#' Note that this mode performs a cell-based search and so cannot be used when \code{x} already contains aggregated profiles.
#'
#' @return A \link{graph} object containing an MST computed on \code{centers}.
#' Each node corresponds to a cluster centroid and has a numeric vector of coordinates in the \code{coordinates} attribute.
#' The edge weight is set to the Euclidean distance and the confidence is stored as the \code{gain} attribute.
